# Spicetify-GUI-Installer
A GUI for Spicetify. Project is originally made by @BaamBuus

Note: Only works on Windows and Linux. Soon there **might** be macOS implementation but PyQt5 is broken on it.

Another Note: The spicetify-edited directory in the main branch is edited Spicetify install.sh files as we couldn't get SSL working correctly with the official ones so we modified them to work.
# Why?
Just to make it easier to install Spicetify. 

This is just made for fun.
# Want to build?
Use pip to download PyQt5 and Requests.
```python
pip install pyqt5 requests
```
And use app.py to run it. You can use PyInstaller to build it.
# Disclaimer 
I do not own Spicetify, This is only made for fun and nothing else.

I do not want to take ownership of the Spicetify Project.
