# Spicetify-GUI-Installer
A GUI for Spicetify. Project is originally made by @BaamBuus

Note: Only works on Windows and Linux. Soon there **might** be macOS implementation but PyQt5 is broken on it.
# Why?
Just to make it easier to install Spicetify. 

This is just made for fun.
# Want to build?
Use pip to download PyQt5
```python
pip install pyqt5
```
And use app.py to run it. You can use PyInstaller to build it.
# Disclaimer 
I do not own Spicetify, This is only made for fun and nothing else.

I do not want to take ownership of the Spicetify Project.
